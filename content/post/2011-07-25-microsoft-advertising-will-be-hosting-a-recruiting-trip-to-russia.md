We are the application development team responsible for developing applications used by advertisers to create and manage their millions of ad campaigns. Challenges are to engineer a highly performing, secure & scalable customer facing web services and backend services that can support millions of transactions per day. We are looking for someone who has strong coding skill in C# /C++ and ability to solve complex problems.

You will be working with a highly motivated team on cutting edge software using agile development strategies and rapid release cycles. 

**The Advertising Delivery Engine Team**

The Ad Delivery Platform team owns the online ad tracking and delivery system. This is a real-time platform that hosts data and code for various auction algorithms for advertisers and content publishers, click-fraud, merchant fraud, content classification, categorization, demographics prediction, search patterns. We are storing and managing TBs of information which enables us to run the auction algorithms and choose the best ads out of hundreds of thousands choices. And we do all that in just a few milliseconds, while sustaining tens of thousands of requests per second, with an uptime of 99.9%. In this environment, only the best designs and architecture will cut it. The amount of data we handle demands building, managing and monitoring a distributed system; ensuring the system health in the presence of individual failures. The Ad Delivery Engine runs 24/7/365. 

**The Revenue and Relevance Team**

Do you want to work on technology at the heart of online monetization? The Revenue and Relevance team is looking for skilled developers- in particular, someone who has deep knowledge of large-scale data mining, machine learning, and/or quantitative analytics for online systems.

A qualified candidate should have a degree in computer science, math, or a statistics degree and experience with software systems and/or applied research in appropriate areas of Computer Science. The algorithms we develop produce the final selection of the ads that are presented to the user upon entering the search query.

Our technology area combines systems, machine learning, data analysis, and economics --- in short, a very technically challenging area. This work makes a direct contribution to Microsoft’s bottom line.
