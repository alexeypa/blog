[Extreme Computing Group (XCG)](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/xcg/default.aspx), в которой я работаю, нанимает разработчиков. В том числе рассматриваются кандидаты из-за рубежа. Само собой, локальные кандидаты предпочтительней, но их как-то не очень заметно, так что у вас есть хороший шанс. Делаются как новые H1B, так и H1B transfer, насколько я могу судить. Позиции ищуться по ключевым словам «eXtreme Computing Group (XCG)». Вот пара ссылок:

От себя добавлю, что проекты у нас сложные и интересные, а люди хорошие. :-) Подаваться нужно через [http://careers.microsoft.com](http://careers.microsoft.com), в крайнем случае – пришлите резюме мне ([alexeypa@gmail.com](mailto:alexeypa@gmail.com)). На разбор писем я собираюсь потратить не так уж много времени. Никаких гарантий, что письмо посланное мне будет передано рекрутеру нет (я даже и не знаю, кто он), так что careers - надежнее.

**About eXtreme Computing Group (XCG):**
We are at the beginning of a far-reaching paradigm shift driven by powerful mobile devices, wireless connectivity, and services hosted across the internet. The Extreme Computing Group’s (XCG) in Microsoft Research is chartered to rethink computing at extreme scale-from alternative quantum computing models, through the revolutionary effects of many core parallelism, to the massive cloud computing infrastructure and applications. As the name suggests, XCG is moving beyond the current practice to develop the hardware and software platforms that will ensure Microsoft’s success in coming decades.

XCG System Software Team is developing innovative hardware and software platforms and technologies to facilitate software development, reduce acquisition and operational costs, and improve reliability and robustness for datacenter and cloud-scale workloads. Our goal is to find and demonstrate the innovations that give Microsoft a competitive advantage and that bring software development for cloud computing into the mainstream. To achieve this end, our projects span the usual hardware-software boundaries to encompass innovations in power distribution, cooling, server design, networking, and system software, programming languages, and tools. To motive and drive our efforts, we are developing innovative cloud computing applications.
