Две истории про переход Windows программистов на Linux и обратно:

  * [I sincerely tried, but I still hate Linux](http://ceklog.kindel.com/2011/10/21/i-sincerely-tried-but-i-still-hate-linux/)

  * [Why I’ve finally had it with my Linux server and I’m moving back to Windows](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/diy-it/why-ive-finally-had-it-with-my-linux-server-and-im-moving-back-to-windows/245)

Вторая особенно хороша - David Gewirtz там выпускает пар. Хотя пара разумных соображений в статье тоже есть.

> I talked with my ISP today. They told me that when they came in this morning, the server monitor was spewing an incredible number of error messages, and — in their words — it was erroring worse than they’ve ever seen.

> Here’s where it gets crazy, though. I asked if they used this distro (CentOS, version 5.6) anywhere else in their organization.

> “Yes,” I was told. “On lots of machines. But we don’t ever run updates. Once it’s installed, we leave it alone.”

> That’s how you survive with a Linux distro apparently. Once it’s installed and works, never, ever update it.

>Here’s what I found:

>   * Linux still sucks, for me. David’s post spoke to me in a very deep way. It simply has too many, too loosely coupled parts for someone who is not born and bred on it to be productive.

>   * I don’t hate Linux because I worked at Microsoft. I hate Linux because it sucks, for me.

>   * The OSS cloud development stacks (Ruby, Node.js, Heroku, Hadoop, etc…) are _shockingly productive_. As long as you get them setup and configured.
